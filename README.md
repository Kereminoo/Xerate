A versatile tool for osu! that can change the speed of any map you please and it can make marathons by merging maps.

**How to use it**

 * Select the files that you want to change the speed of, or if you are making marathons, add all the maps that you want to merge to the queue. (You can input a rate for the maps in the marathon)
 * If you're making marathons, enter the marathon name, marathon version (difficulty name) and the break length (miliseconds) entries.
 * Click the export map button and you are good to go!

**Known Issues**

 * Xerate is flagged by antiviruses even though its a safe program
 * The OD and AR entries do absolutely nothing if you're making a marathon.
