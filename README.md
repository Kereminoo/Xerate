A versatile tool for osu! that can change the speed of any map you please and it can make marathons by merging maps.

**How to use it**

 * Select a file with a .osu extension, or select multiple files if you want to merge them.
 * Input the rate and pitch if you are changing map speeds, or input the break length between maps and the marathon name if you are merging them.
 * Click the export map button and you are good to go!

**Known Issues**

 * Events and TimingPoints in merged maps are slightly off
 * The pitch changes even if you type nothing in the pitch entry
 * Every map and its audio file must be in the same folder to merge maps
 * Xerate is flagged by antiviruses even though its a safe program
